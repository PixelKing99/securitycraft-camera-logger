this script exploits a bug where security cameras load for all players on a server when they are accessed, this means that even if you are far away you can find someones base just by them accessing a camera while you are online
this script just tells you the coords of the camera that is loaded and then stores so you dont have to write it down
to use this script install the mod jsMacros and set up this script to run on the EnitiyLoad event

i reported this bug and this script will be useless after the next release but i guess if you havent updated its still useful
